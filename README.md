# Optimal-Pathfinding-at-IIT-Kanpur-Using-C++
This is a C++ program that takes the source and destination locations within IIT Kanpur from the user and displays the shortest route and distance between them. Additionally, it features a map for better navigation.

The idea is implemented using Graph and Heap data structures. The graph has nodes and edges. Nodes represent campus locations containing information such as name, department, and connections to other locations. Edges represent the paths between locations, with their lengths as the cost.

By using different algorithms like Dijkstra, Breadth-First Search, and Depth-First Search, the shortest path between the source and destination is determined. The total distance is calculated, and the optimal route is displayed.

# Requirements
Dijkstra's Algorithm: C++ Program for Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
Depth-First Search: Depth-First Search (DFS) for a Graph
Breadth-First Search: Breadth-First Search (BFS) for a Graph
